# ELLO ðŸ‘‹  JEKYLL: A vCard-style Jekyll Theme

Ello is a simple animated Jekyll vCard-style theme by [Randall](https://ran-dall.github.io), optimized for use with GitHub Pages (but can be used wherever Jekyll can be installed).

Utilizing this theme you can create a simple vCard-style web site with embedded `h-card` and `Schema` data; which can then serve as a centralized location with all your contact data.

## Installation

Add this line to your Jekyll site's `Gemfile`:

```ruby
gem "ello-jekyll-vcard-theme"
```

And add this line to your Jekyll site's `_config.yml`:

```yaml
theme: ello-jekyll-vcard-theme
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install ello-jekyll-vcard-theme

## Usage

### TL;DR

Use `main.yaml` to update the information on the `contact-box` area with whatever you wish to display. 

Use `details.yaml` to list all the profiles you want to link to from your site. Currently, there can be up to 24 contact links; but it's something you can modify [on **line 216**](https://github.com/ran-dall/ello-jekyll/blob/42535e1874e0d0987e0926b241d9bb91525464d3/_sass/componets/contact-box.scss#L216).

---

If you install this theme as a `remote-theme` for GitHub Pages or  as a gem (GitHub Pages or not), you'll be required to make your own `index.html`, `_data/main.yaml`, and `data/details.yaml` files. You can use the files included in this repository (which initially came from my [GitHub Pages site](https://ran-dall.github.io)) as a working example of what's required.

###### GitHub Pages

If you plan on using this theme on GitHub Pages, it is prefered you use is as a 'remote theme.' To do so, you must declare `ello-jekyll-vcard-theme` in your `_config.yaml` file as a `remote-theme` as described in [this blog post](https://github.blog/2017-11-29-use-any-theme-with-github-pages/).

#### [`h-card` Mircoformat2](microformats.org/wiki/h-card)

The `h-card` Mircoformat2 format is a simple specification which updates the `hcard` Microformat specification, [which focused on bringing `vCards` to the web.](https://hcardcreator.com/articles/what-hcard-vcard-microformats) Aside from publishing information about a person, [when combined with `XFN`](http://microformats.org/wiki/xfn-to-foaf), `h-card` has some of the basic functionality required to declare relationships to achieve [social-network-portability](http://microformats.org/wiki/hcard-supporting-user-profiles).

The `details.yaml` file, has an assigned `h-card` area embedded with the specific `h-card` options in each `contact` entry.

To add more Networks, you must also add the network in `_sass/components/contact-box.scss`.

You can add the network anywhere you desire in the following format...

```
  &.<slug-from-details-yaml> {
    @include icon-styles($<network-variable-from-details-yaml>)
  }
```

Currently, there can be up to 24 contact links; but it's something you can modify [on **line 216**](https://github.com/ran-dall/ello-jekyll/blob/42535e1874e0d0987e0926b241d9bb91525464d3/_sass/componets/contact-box.scss#L216).

You are more than welcome to add more with [Jekyll's override feature for Gem themes](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/themes/#overriding-theme-defaults) and/or contribute the modification to [this theme's GitHub repository](https://github.com/ran-dall/ello-jekyll).


## Contributing

Bug reports and pull requests are welcome on GitHub at https://github.com/ran-dall/ello-jekyll. This project is intended to be a safe, welcoming space for collaboration, and contributors are expected to adhere to the [Contributor Covenant](http://contributor-covenant.org) code of conduct.

## Development

To set up your environment to develop this theme, run `bundle install`.

Your theme is setup just like a normal Jekyll site! To test your theme, run `bundle exec jekyll serve` and open your browser at `http://localhost:4000`. This starts a Jekyll server using your theme. Add pages, documents, data, etc. like normal to test your theme's contents. As you make modifications to your theme and to your content, your site will regenerate and you should see the changes in the browser after a refresh, just like normal.

When your theme is released, only the files in `_layouts`, `_includes`, `_sass` and `assets` tracked with Git will be bundled.
To add a custom directory to your theme-gem, please edit the regexp in `vcard.gemspec` accordingly.

## License
